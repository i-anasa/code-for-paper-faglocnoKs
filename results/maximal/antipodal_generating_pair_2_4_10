# output:

 Structure of G = <x,y> = S8.
 |G| = 40320.
 G Is transitive: true.
 G Is primitive: true.
 G contains the mirror reflection b. {x,y} is an antipodal pair.
 G acts with signature (0;+;[-];{(2,4,10)}) under the epimorphism:
    a -> (2,8)(3,5)(6,7)
    b -> (1,4)(2,3)(5,8)(6,7)
    c -> (2,4)(6,8)
