## Section 4.1 Permutation groups acting with maximal signatures

There is a table containing pairs of permutations {X,Y} that presumably generate groups acting with signature (0;+;[-];{(2,s,t)}) on non-orientable surfaces. The key point of the proof is that the group generated by X and Y contains certain involutory permutation.
For each one of this pairs, there is a file named "antipodal_generating_pair_2_s_t" in which such claim is proved. They make use of the script "antipodal_generating_pair.gap" to prove that the mirror reflection is in the group generated by the two permutations. It also provides basic information about the group itself: order, structure, whether it is transitive and whether it is primitive.

## Section 4.2 Presentations for some infinite families of groups

Some families of groups are presented. For each one, there is a base finite group. First, it is proved that such group (up to isomorphism) is the smallest group acting with the given (NEC triangle) signature on a non-orientable surface. This is proved using the script "smallest_quotient_triangle.gap". The output for each signature is in the file "smallest_quotient_triangle_2_s_t".

Second, a presentation is derived for each family of groups, based on the properties of certain surface-kernel subgroup in an NEC triangle group with this given signature.

Pending.
