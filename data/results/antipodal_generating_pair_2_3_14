# output:

 Structure of G = <x,y> = S9.
 |G| = 362880.
 G Is transitive: true.
 G Is primitive: true.
 G contains the mirror reflection b. {x,y} is an antipodal pair.
 G acts with signature (0;+;[-];{(2,3,14)}) under the epimorphism:
    a -> (2,6)(3,4)(5,7)(8,9)
    b -> (2,3)(4,6)(8,9)
    c -> (1,2)(5,6)(7,8)
